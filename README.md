# BrentKungAdder
Designed a N bit parametrised logarithmic adder using Brent Kung architecture. Implemented the design in Verilog and verified its operation using Modelsim with appropriate test vectors. Identified the critical path of the design to determine the worst case delay of the adder
Synthesize the design and simulate the adder with testbench tb_adder.v
